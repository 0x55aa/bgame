# bgame - Bert's Game

A github repository for work on my roguelike. Right now, it's little more than a graphics framework:
the engine/ folder contains the framework required for SDL2 (using a terminal texture, similar to libtcod) and ncurses as back-ends. There's also the skeleton of a stack-based mode system.

Eventually, this will become a useful library and hopefully also a game!

Right now, it's listed as GPL2 because I like it. If anyone would like to use this, I'm happy to talk about that (and I'm the only contributor, so it's mine to re-license).
